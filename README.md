# Emacs and R quickstart

A quick start guide for Emacs for R users, for people that have never used Emacs, and don't care about all the non-R functionality.

I don't care if this isn't complete, or covers every point. It works. End of story.

# Basic shortcut starting points

Some basic info to get you started, and to make sense of the keyboard shortcuts used here and elsewhere when discussing Emacs.  
`C-` = hold the Control/Ctrl key.  
e.g., `C-c` means Ctrl-c

`M-` = hold the 'Meta' key, otherwise known as Alt on a normal person's keyboard  
e.g., `M-x` means Alt-x

# Copying and pasting

You're not going to get very far without copying and pasting from Stackoverflow. So:

`M-w` = copy  
`C-w` = cut  
`C-y` = paste (yank)
